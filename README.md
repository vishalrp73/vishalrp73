## G'DAY FRIENDS

I’m the artist formerly known as ‘Vishal Prakash’ attempting to make it VEGAS BIG as a developer. My government name makes for good hiring prospects - but * BUYER BEWARE * - I’m FIJIAN Indian, which means I laze around all day drinking kava.

I also majored in Sociology and Film, so you just know I have no idea what I’m talking about. That said, teach a man to code and he’ll be frustrated crushing bugs all his life 🤷🏾‍♂️

My ultimate life goal is for me to be so successful in this business that the University of Auckland eventually offers me an honorary Comp-Sci degree in compensation for the amount of debt I racked up attending that school (would do it 10/10 times again tho).

My favourite project I’ve worked on is my personal film blog, which - in retrospect, performs like an exhausted mule lugging Tony Soprano - but is a real passion project. It’s a collection of 50 of my favourite films / films I just so happen to be watching at this point in time, with a designed interface, personal reviews and images (collated or designed) from scratch. While it marinates in self-assured elitism (like all GREAT film blogs), I saw this as a real personal and creative playground in my first experiments with React.
